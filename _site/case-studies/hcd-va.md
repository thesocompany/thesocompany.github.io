#####“We must strive to treat others the way they want to be treated. Becoming a truly Veteran centric organization means living the platinum rule and organizing ourselves and our services around the needs of Veterans.” – Secretary Bob McDonald, Designing for Veterans: A Toolkit for Human-Centered Design, VA Center For Innovation, Oct. 2015

##### The Problem
Veterans are diverse and have needs that don't always fit outdated archetypical services and care. Many new transformative initiatives require, what Secretary Bob McDonald called, "Veteran-centric" thinking. VA needed a team to help them with this "Veteran-centric" research so it can transform and improve VA's Veteran experience for a variety of products, services, and processes.

##### The Solution

The So Company enables this "Veteran-centric" research for VA by providing Veteran subject matter expertise and senior design research services for VA's Veterans Experience Office Human Centered Design (HCD) work. 

Our dedicated business model of employing subject matter experts for our clients naturally fit the unique demands of VA. Richard Wheeler, a So Company Partner, design media arts professor, artist, and former US Army Reservist provides VA ongoing Senior Design Research services for their HCD research.

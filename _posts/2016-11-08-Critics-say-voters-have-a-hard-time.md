### Plain Language:

-  "...voters who possess an acceptable form of photo identification for voting listed below are still required to present it in order to vote in person in all Texas election..." Critics say voters have a hard time with Texas's voting law because it's written at a "20th grade" reading level, [reports KUT.org's Ashley Lopez](http://kut.org/post/why-voter-id-confusion-because-rules-were-written-20th-grade-reading-level).

-  Folks who don't understand their own health conditions, the medications they take or the directions they receive from doctors face life-or-death situations, [reports the Augusta Chronicle's Judi Kanne](http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2016-10-31/health-literacy-can-be-life-or-death-matter).

-  [Communicate Health suggests](http://communicatehealth.com/2013/08/what-goes-in-must-come-out/) going for words kids would understand when writing about health. For example, rather than "diarrhea," go with "watery poop." Words to avoid? Not going there... 

-  Columnists from the Center for Civic Design [write in The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/11/03/why-are-ballot-measures-so-confusing/ballot-measures-need-to-be-written-in-plain-language) that some ballot questions seem written purely to confuse voters - and that may be the case. They write it took them an hour to figure out one solar-energy ballot measure in Florida.

### Human-Centered Design:

-  Whoa. Monotype Studio just released a new font based on human-centered
design, [reports Yahoo News](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/introducing-between-typeface-monotype-versatile-120000394.html). That's right: a font. It's softer and gentler than the "hard and sharp perfection of 20th-century typefaces." You know you wanna look... 

-  After a paper came out asking if "design thinking is the new liberal
arts," [The Wall Street Journal's Irving Wladawsky-Berger argues it is not](http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2016/11/04/is-design-thinking-the-new-liberal-arts/). Why? "Design thinking" tends to skip what has already been learned, while liberal arts is what has already been learned.

### Open Data:

-  A new report shows open-data access is improving in the federal government, but it still needs to be standardized, [reports Federal Times' Carten Cordell](http://www.federaltimes.com/articles/report-open-datas-positives-are-still-in-their-infancy).

-  Organizations releasing open data understand they're doing a community service, but they also know the data could lead to negative news stories about what's wrong in a community, [reports Government Technology's Ben Miller](http://www.govtech.com/civic/How-to-Overcome-the-Bad-Story-Fear-and-Open-Up-Your-Data.html). But that's the point: You can't fix something you don't know about. Experts say communities that start small and focus on the successes of releasing the data can help combat the fear of negative press.

### Open Government:

-  As the Sunlight Foundation changes direction, [Propublica announces](https://www.propublica.org/article/taking-cues-and-some-projects-from-sunlight-labs) it will take over some of the nonprofit's projects, such as Politwoops, CapitolWords and the House Staff Directory.

### Vet Politics:

-  [Military Times' Leo Shane](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/four-defense-veterans-races-to-watch?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEBB-11/8&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief) breaks down the races that are most likely to affect Veterans based on Congressional committees.

-  [And Shane reports](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/election-day-look-back-national-security?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEBB-11/8&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief) that most national security experts, military watchers and Vets feel like the election hasn't touched on their top issues.

### Vet Love:

-  A new documentary details the lives of the service members who guard the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, [reports Military Times' Charlsy Panzino](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/unknowns-documentary-debuts-online-on-dvd-for-veterans-day?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEBB%2011.3.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). It was produced by a Veteran and will be released on Veterans Day.

-  And another new film, "Acronym," looks at alternative treatments forpost-traumatic stress, [reports Military Times' Amanda Miller](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/film-acronym-looks-inside-alternative-ptsd-therapies?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEBB%2011.3.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

-  A new report says VA has great goals through MyVA, but it doesn't have a
great way to evaluate or implement those goals, [reports The Washington
Post's Joe Davidson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/03/va-gets-many-improvement-ideas-but-often-fails-on-evaluation-implementation/?wpisrc=3Dnl_fed&wpmm=3D1).

-  A new study finds military wives have higher rates of mental illness and are more likely to binge drink than other married women, [reports the San Diego Union Tribune's Carl Prine](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sd-me-substance-mental-20161101-htmlstory.html?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEBB%20Mil%2011.4.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

-  Apparently, it someone's birthday this week, [reports Military.com](http://www.military.com/marine-corps-birthday/why-marine-corps-birthday-matters.html). Eat cake, and Hoo-rah.

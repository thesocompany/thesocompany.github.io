### Open Data:

- Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, says he’s working on an inventory of government agencies to make sure the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act doesn’t get lost during the election, [reports](http://federalnewsradio.com/open-datatransparency/2016/05/warner-cautiously-optimistic-data-act-rollout/) Federal News Radio. He’s been sending notes to agencies asking for progress reports. Warner says it’s good for entrepreneurs. 

- NYU Tandon’s Gov Lab is looking at how companies are using the data released by the U.S. federal government, [reports](http://technical.ly/brooklyn/2016/05/31/nyu-tandon-columbia-govlab/) Technical.ly. No one yet understands the impact, and companies are still working out best practices. 

- The Europeiska Data Portalen released its first report, “[Digital Transformation and Open Data.](http://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/edp-analytical-report-n1-digital-transformations.pdf)” They looked at 600 use cases from the private sector from around the world, focusing on how open data Is re-used and who is re-using it. 

    - The IT sector is most likely to re-use data, followed by the public sector.

    - “Enrichers” were most likely to use the data at about 50 percent—these are organizations who want to gain better or new insights for services or products for their customers. 

    - “Enablers” rarely used it, at about 3 percent. Enablers provide platforms and tech other companies can use.

    - “Developers,” or people who analyze data and create services and products, make up about 18 percent of users. 

    - People didn’t use it because they didn’t know about it, didn’t know how, didn’t know if they were allowed to, were limited by the data quality, had internal IT issues, or had licensing problems. 

    - The group recommended that governments publish open data, apply the “open by default” principle, , use an appropririate open license, and search for interaction with re-users.

    - The recommended the private sector use open data as a resource today, use data from any sector rather than one’s own, choose an integral strategy for digital transformation, and start small. 

    - They also list out [benefits](http://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/using-data/benefits-of-open-data) of open data, such as job stimulation, efficiency gains and social welfare improvement.

- June 4 was the [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://cache.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016/), and the White House, as well as several federal agencies, encouraged 100 U.S. cities to open up information to allow citizens to try to solve problems, Government Technology [reports](http://www.govtech.com/Federal-Agencies-Call-for-Aid-at-National-Day-of-Civic-Hacking.html). Hackers worked to make it easier to apply for food stamps, apply for affordable housing and combat Zika, as well as other problem areas identified by the government. 

- Royal Dutch Shell became the first U.K.-incorporated oil, gas or mining company to report on its payments to governments as required by the United Kingdom’s new transparent reporting process, [reports](http://www.publishwhatyoupay.org/shell-reports-2015-payments-to-governments-using-open-data/) Publish What You Pay. They paid out about $22 billion, including about $1.4 billion to Iraq. The United States and United Kingdom paid Shell. 

- China is also interested in open data, at least for science, [reports](http://www.godan.info/blog-posts/godan-sponsors-open-data-workshop-sichuan) Godan. More than 100 scientists participated in a “Knowledge Management and Open Data” conference.

- Amsterdam’s Smart City initiative takes Open Data and applies it to everything from figuring out how many bike lanes commuters need to enabling trash trucks to make fewer trips, MIT Sloan [reports](http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/six-lessons-from-amsterdams-smart-city-initiative/). To make it work, cities using similar initiatives need chief technology officers, citizen input, expectation management and pilot programs. 

- Thirteen Illinois Health and Human Services agencies have agreed to share their data, [reports](https://www.socrata.com/blog/llinois-agencies-pledge-share-data/) Socrata.

- Open Data has made its way into the presidential election as Donald Trump is not interested in using data and analytics in his campaign, [reports](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/281934-trumps-aversion-to-data-puts-rnc-on-the-hot-seat) The Hill. Trump has said data is “overrated.” Hillary Clinton has an in-house data team and is also contracting out to a start-up. Bernie Sanders’ campaign exists because of analytics. 

- Pennsylvania’s Department of Transportation has released road and bridge data to the public, [reports](http://www.equipmentworld.com/penndot-opens-up-road-and-bridge-data-to-the-public/) Equipment World. 

- An open-data initiative has led to the discovery of genetic variants connected to breast and ovarian cancer one year after the initiative was begun, [reports](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/one-year-after-launch-brca-share-open-data-initiative-reveals-new-findings-on-brca-gene-mutations-linked-to-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-risk-300277710.html) PR NewsWire.

### Plain Language:

#### Case studies:

- In 2010, the IRS realized that one-quarter of people being audited didn't realize they were being audited because the letters IRS sent out confused them. Most people did not know the meaning of the word “levy.” The IRS decided to [rewrite all of their letters](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/general/news/2011/05/16/9588/irs-aims-for-letter-perfect-language/). Then, they created a [new office](http://www.visualwebcaster.com/IRS/73366/bios/Patterson.html) to do just that.

>I decided to send out Greatest Hits this week during my layover in Philly. I like it here. I went to a nice little Quaker boarding school nearby, so I'm feeling rather nostalgic. Anyway...

### Copyediting Greatest Hits:

The content team is constantly honing our plain-language skills. Here are two examples of edits made last week to keep vets.gov content straightforward for Veterans, followed by a forthcoming addition to the style guide:

| | Original | Plain Language |
|-----|-----|-----|
|1)| "VA will contact you by phone to schedule the exam." | "VA will call you to schedule the exam."|

|2)| He or she can see the medical records you have submitted, statements you and others have provided about your claim, and your military medical and personnel records.| This person can see the medical records you have given VA, statements from you and others about your claim, and your military medical and personnel records.|

I regularly add to my ever-growing list of words to avoid, accompanied by plain-language options we can opt for instead. A forthcoming addition I'd like to mention here may fall more within the category of contextually appropriate word choice than plain language, but it is one to think carefully about before using on vets.gov: 

Avoid "visit" in favor of "go to":

| This | *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * | Rather than |
|-----|------------------------------------|-----|
| "Go to your local regional office." |  | "Visit your local regional office." |

The word "visit" sounds like a forced attempt to be cheerful about your need to go to the regional office. As if some friends will be there or your favorite uncle who you don't see very often might show up to see you. 

We frequently hear this word used to refer to a doctor's appointment. When medical staff talk about my "doctor's visit," I always think, "Hey, I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to be, so don't make it sound like it's going to be a welcome weekend get away to a quaint small town on the Olympic Peninsula." 

| This |   | Rather than |
|-----|-----|-----|
| "If you would like a copy of the final report from your claim exam, go to MyHealtheVet or call VA at 1-800-827-1000." |   | "If you would like a copy of the final report from your claim exam, visit MyHealtheVet or call VA at 1-800-827-1000." |

That's it for this week!

An aside... to give you a sense of how focused my brain is on plain language these days, I started editing the flight attendant on my way to Philly: The captain has reilluminated the fasten-your-seatbelt sign.

Reilluminated?! Are you kidding me...?

### Plain Language:
 - As LinkedIn encourages people to update their profiles, they’ve also been pushing a

### Open Data:
- If scientists don’t share their research code, their work can’t be reproduced or verified, so many journals have begun requiring code for publication, [reports Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/why-scientists-must-share-their-research-code-1.20504). And the byproduct? Everyone benefits from the information and research moves faster.

 - [Huffington Post is](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/apolitical/theres-a-revolutionary-su_b_12081730.html) calling the “opaque” sounding open-data “subculture” in governments around the world “revolutionary,” and says it offers the best possibility of creating change for the better.

### Job Search:

### What we’re reading:

### Plain Language:

-  Almost all colleges and universities don't feature plain language on
their websites, [reports Satellite Press Releases and News](http://satprnews.com/2016/11/10/university-and-college-websites-are-struggling-to-learn-the-lessons-of-writing-in-plain-language/).

### Open Data:

-  Smart cities use data to make technology effective, rather than haphazardly tossing tech at problems and expecting it to help, [reports
Govtech.com](http://www.govtech.com/fs/Cool-Cities-Rely-on-Technology-Smart-Cities-Rely-on-Data-and-Partnerships.html).

-  And [UrbanToronto.ca reports](http://urbantoronto.ca/news/2016/11/intelligent-cities-summit-welcome-smart-city) that those systems also need to be integrated to provide people with the best services.

-  [PLOS has just announced](http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2016/11/10/in-celebration-of-open-data/) a new open-data collection, which includes all of their reports about open data.

### Open Government:

-  The [Sunlight Foundation reports](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/11/10/the-trump-questions-what-will-transparency-and-open-government-look-like-in-the-next-white-house/)
there are still many questions about how Donald Trump will handle transparency and open government because he didn't respond to those questions on the campaign trail.

### Contracting:

-  Businesses in Sacramento are asking city governments to test new technologies before buying them, [reports the Sacramento Business Journal](http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2016/11/11/tech-startups-lobby-for-alternative-model-of.html).

-  How will a Trump administration affect the contracting scene? Hard to
know, but there may be more outsourcing, [reports Washington Technology's
Nick Wakeman](https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2016/11/trump-election-thoughts.aspx).

### Vet Politics:

-  As Donald Trump begins the transition to the presidency, female service
members wonder if they'll still have the chance to serve in infantry rolls, [reports
Military Times Andrew Tilghman](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/donald-trump-women-combat-obama-military-policy?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMil%20EBB%2011.14.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

### Vet Love:

-  Vets make up one-third of the federal workforce, [reports Military Times'
Leo Shane](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/veterans-federal-workforce-data?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMil%20EBB%2011.14.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). This comes in part because of an Obama Administration policy to hire more Veterans.

-  Female Service Members say they don't feel civilians understand or value
their service, [reports Military Times' Leo Shane](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/swan-survey-women-troops-vets?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEarly%20Bird%20Brief%2011.15.2016&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

-  [Outdoor magazine reports](http://www.outsideonline.com/2133021/6-gear-companies-support-our-veterans?utm_source=3Dwhatyoumissed&utm_medium=3Dnewsletter&utm_campaign=3D11112016&spMailingID=3D27046442&spUserID=3DOTc1ODIxNjY2NzYS1&spJobID=3D922267776&spReportId=3DOTIyMjY3Nzc2S0) on six gear companies that give back to Veterans. Anyone need new flip-flops?

### What we're reading:

-  [David Kadavy, author of *Design for Hackers*, argues](https://medium.com/the-mission/find-your-now-and-youll-never-procrastinate-again-e12cc11fe232#.yz9dblmbl) that you can't think of a day as having 24 hours if you want to break a procrastination habit.

-  Having a hard time avoiding social media? (It may be easier this week than others...) Consider replacing a Facebook habit with a book habit, [Kadavy writes for Medium](https://medium.com/the-mission/hijack-your-facebook-habit-with-a-book-reading-habit-d4bfb8a6c520#.qqaqaattv).

### Plain Language:

- A throwback to January, but the Center for Plain Language has a nice [blog](http://centerforplainlanguage.org/google-content-guidelines/) about how
plain language can increase traffic through search engines.

### Human-Centered Design:

- Big news from Veterans Affairs: The federal government has named its
first-ever chief design officer, Sarah B. Brooks. Brooks began at VA as a
Presidential Innovation Fellow in human-centered design. She was VA's first
director of design and insight. She has worked closely with The So Company
on several projects, and it's great to see both the government
understanding human-centered design is important to warrant a new position,
as well as to see Brooks fill the role.

### Open Data:

- Fewer than 5 percent of cancer patients will be part of a clinical
trial, in part because information about the trials is not easy to find.
So, the National Cancer Institute recently launched an application to make
it easier to find those trials, [reports Federal News Radio](http://federalnewsradio.com/technology/2016/09/cancer-moonshot-unleashing-power-data/).

The issue?
